# Linear Regression Labs (ISLP, Chapter 3)

This repository contains my practice notebooks from *An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python (ISLP)*, Chapter 3 labs.  
The focus is on linear regression, extending from simple models to more flexible approaches using the typical Boston Housing Data of houses around
Boston neighborhood from 2005 to create a model which predicts future house prices

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

1. Simple Linear Regression
   - Fitting medv ~ lstat (Boston dataset)
   - Interpreting coefficients
   - Confidence intervals & hypothesis testing
   - Residual plots & diagnostics

2. Multiple Linear Regression
   - Adding predictors
   - Checking model fit with RÂ² and adjusted RÂ²
   - Assessing statistical significance

3. Polynomial Regression
   - Adding polynomial terms (poly(lstat, degree=2,3,...))
   - Capturing curvature in relationships
   - Model comparison with ANOVA

4. Interaction Terms
   - Modeling joint effects (rm * lstat)
   - Interpreting interactions

5. Qualitative Predictors
   - Using dummy variables for categorical data
   - Example: chas (Charles River indicator)

6. Model Diagnostics
   - Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for multicollinearity
   - ANOVA for nested models
   - Residual analysis for assumptions
